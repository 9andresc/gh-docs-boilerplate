# Github Docs Boilerplate

This repo is a template for projects on github. Specifically, it is an example of the documentation and project management tools that should be included in any project.

## Installation

If you are starting a project completely from scratch, clone this repo right into that folder. Otherwise, copy files into your project as needed.

## Usage

These files only change how your project behaves on github, and most of them will only take effect once merged into your default branch (usually `master` or `dev`).

Keep them up-to-date as your project evolves.

## Contents

Here's a rundown of the files included, as well as why they're important:

### Readme

Every project should have a Readme (usually a Markdown file). It should describe your specific project and have at least three sections:

1. **Project Name** and description.
1. **Installation** List any major dependencies, system requirements, and gotchas.
1. **Usage** How to run the project.

### Pull Request Template

This Markdown file prepopulates new Pull Requests. Using it as a prompt helps team members write infomative pull requests, makes code easier to test, and leaves a paper trail of code and decisions.

### Issue Template(s)
